Instead of having sensors confirm an earthquake event, or provide intensity triggers, Grillo has developed low cost sensors that transmit raw data to remote data centers in realtime using Internet-of-Things (IoT) protocols. The data centers then process this vast quantity of data using Big Data technologies, i.e. powerful and scalable clusters of servers, to determine if an earthquake is happening. By leveraging the power of the cloud, Grillo is able to perform much more complicated algorithms than was possible before.

It is hard to achieve both, but a good start is having a very dense network of sensors; the closer a station is to the earthquake, the faster the detection is done; the more stations you have confirming an earthquake, the more certain you are its not a passing truck. Grillo solves this problem by reducing the work a sensor needs to do (this is passed on to the cloud), and therefore its cost.
